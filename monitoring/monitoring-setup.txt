# Now we're going to add prometheus to our k8s cluster - this enables tools to view the health and status of the k8s cluster.
helm install prometheus oci://ghcr.io/prometheus-community/charts/prometheus

# To interact with prometheus (if you're not going to buy Lens or some equivalent), we're going to install grafana:
kubectl apply -f ./grafana-setup.yaml

# Now to set up the httproute which will allow nginx to route to this service
kubectl apply -f ./httproute.yaml

# The k8s dashboard id for grafana is 15661
